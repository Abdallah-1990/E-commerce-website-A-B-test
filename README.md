In this project,
<ul>
<li>Using python, an A/B test was implemented to understand the results which was ran by an e-commerce website.</li>

<li>A dataset was worked through contains attributes such as (ID , timestamp , individuals who worked on landing page (old or new page) and finally the label if these individuals converted or not ).</li>

<li>My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</li>
</ul>
