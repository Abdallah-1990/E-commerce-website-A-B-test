It has been worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through a dataset contains attributes such as (ID , timestamp , individuals who worked on landing page (old or new page) and finally the label if these individuals convert or not ) to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
